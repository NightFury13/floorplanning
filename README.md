Calculating an optimal cutting plan
===================================
Project IFT-2015-TP2 Calculating an optimal cutting plan (minimum area) represented by a binary tree structure.

In my solution that also implementing an algorithm that approximates a optimal cutting plan. This algorithm does not give the optimal solution, but the calculation time is more respectable. "Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Floorplanning".

Scenario:

For a company that sends more objects to one consignee, it is important to minimize the volume of the box to use to send these objects. The problem here is to find, for a list of given objects of different sizes, the spatial configuration that allows to use the smallest box possible, that is to say to minimize wasted space in the box .
